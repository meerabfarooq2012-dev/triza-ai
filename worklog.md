Task ID: 1
Agent: Main
Task: Fix analytics "Failed to fetch seller analytics" error

Work Log:
- Identified root cause: analytics API route used SQLite-specific `strftime()` in raw SQL queries which don't work with PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Rewrote entire `/api/analytics/seller/route.ts` to use database-agnostic Prisma ORM methods instead of raw SQL
- Replaced `$queryRaw` calls with `findMany`, `aggregate`, `count`, and `groupBy` Prisma methods
- Processed data grouping in JavaScript (monthly/daily revenue, top products, top customers, revenue by type)
- Optimized to reduce memory pressure: split into 2 batches (lightweight aggregates in parallel, data queries sequential)
- Combined top products and revenue by type into a single query to reduce total queries from 17 to 14

Stage Summary:
- Analytics API now works with both SQLite (local dev) and PostgreSQL (Supabase production)
- Server stability improved - no more OOM crashes on repeated analytics requests
- All 3 API test requests returned 200 successfully
- Coupon & Promo Code System was already fully built in previous sessions

- Added ChartErrorBoundary around each chart section for graceful degradation
- Pushed commits to GitHub (which auto-deploys to Vercel)
- Synced Supabase PostgreSQL schema using prisma db push
- Verified analytics API returns 200 OK on both local and Vercel

Stage Summary:
- ChunkLoadError is now handled globally with auto-page-reload
- Analytics component uses dynamic imports for recharts, so chart load failures don't crash the whole page
- Supabase database schema is fully synced
- Vercel deployment at https://marketo-alpha.vercel.app is live and working

Task ID: 6
Agent: Bug Fix Agent
Task: Fix critical frontend bugs (8 fixes)

Work Log:
- Fix 1: Replaced useCallback/useEffect pattern in product-detail.tsx fetchProduct with cancellation token useEffect pattern to prevent stale data overwrites on rapid productId changes
- Fix 2: Replaced useCallback/useEffect pattern in gig-detail.tsx fetchGig with cancellation token useEffect pattern; removed unused `useCallback` import
- Fix 3: Fixed flash sale price not applied in cart — changed `effectivePrice ?? product.price` to `effectivePrice ?? (activeFlashSale ? activeFlashSale.salePrice : product.price)` in handleAddToCart
- Fix 4: Added useEffect to reset selectedImage when it exceeds gallery bounds after variant image changes; moved hook before early returns to comply with React rules-of-hooks
- Fix 5: Changed variant-selector handleSelectValue to use `delete` instead of setting empty string when deselecting an option, ensuring selectedOptions only contains active selections
- Fix 6: Removed `onVariantChange` from useEffect dependency array in variant-selector to prevent infinite re-render loop from unstable callback reference
- Fix 7: Added shopId existence guards in seller-dashboard ShippingSettings and ReturnsPage components to prevent undefined cast when no shop exists
- Fix 8: Added optimistic update and error feedback to handleToggleFavorite — reverts state and shows toast on API failure instead of silent fail

Agent: Security Fix Agent
Task: Fix critical API security bugs (XSS, auth bypass, SQLite compat, ownership check)

Work Log:
- Fix 1: XSS in sandbox payment HTML — Added escapeHtml() function, sanitized token/gateway/orderId for HTML output, used encodeURIComponent for JS template literals, added encodeURIComponent() on callback URL construction in script
- Fix 2: Fake admin check in returns route — Replaced `adminNote !== undefined` with database-backed admin check using `db.user.findUnique` to verify `isAdmin === true`
- Fix 3: No auth on admin transactions route — Added admin authentication check requiring userId param and verifying `isAdmin` from database before returning data
- Fix 4: SQLite mode: 'insensitive' compatibility — Removed `mode: 'insensitive' as const` from tags filter in both /api/products/route.ts and /api/search/route.ts (SQLite doesn't support this option)
- Fix 5: Product creation shop ownership check — Added verification that the requesting user owns the shop before allowing product creation (403 if mismatch)
- Ran lint — 2 pre-existing errors (gig-detail.tsx, product-detail.tsx), 3 pre-existing warnings — no new errors introduced

Task ID: 10
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix theme toggle syncExternalStore error

Work Log:
- Identified root cause: theme-toggle.tsx imported `syncExternalStore` from `react` (wrong — should be `useSyncExternalStore`)
- First fix attempt: changed to `useSyncExternalStore`, but Turbopack module resolution still failed at runtime
- Final fix: replaced `useSyncExternalStore`-based `useMounted()` with standard `useState`/`useEffect` pattern (compatible with Turbopack)
- Added eslint-disable comment for `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (standard pattern for hydration detection)
- Verified with agent-browser: Light/Dark/System toggle works correctly
- Verified `dark` class is properly applied/removed on `<html>` element
- Verified theme persists in `localStorage` under `theme` key
- Verified zero console errors after fix
- Lint passes with 0 errors (2 pre-existing warnings)

Stage Summary:
- Theme toggle fixed — was broken due to incorrect React API import (`syncExternalStore` instead of `useSyncExternalStore`)
- Used simpler `useState`/`useEffect` pattern instead of `useSyncExternalStore` for Turbopack compatibility
- All 3 theme modes (Light, Dark, System) work correctly
- Theme preference persists across page reloads via next-themes localStorage
